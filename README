Place browser_config.xml into the directory /etc/agile

Extract the contents of agile_browser into your site root dir or where ever you would like it served from.

Troubleshooting:

Note: Unless needed for logging / debugging PHP.ini should be set to ignore NOTICE level warnings.

Permission issues
* Make sure your uploads directory ie /var/www/agile_browser/uploads/ has the proper permissions.  user/group www-data should have full read, write and delete permissions.
* Agile browser performs some operations (like zipping and deleting local temporary files) which require "safe mode" to be turned off.  By default it should be.

Upload issues
*Agile browser supports uploads of files up to 1gig in size.  Your PHP.ini file will need to be updated to support this functionality as well.
